computer-generated texts. This study is part of a larger project to see how good or bad computers are at producing or understanding human language,such as English. In this study you will be asked to rate the quality of computer-generated texts\/sentences. We will use this information to see what the computer is good at, and to see where it can still be improved.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>What do I have to do?<\/strong><br>\nAs mentioned above, you will be asked to rate the quality of computer-generated texts. In this study, you will be asked to read 40 short sentences, and to provide your judgment. We are interested in your intuition as a native speaker of English, so you don\u2019t need to think too long about it.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Expected duration<\/strong><br>\nWe expect this study to take about fifteen minutes of your time. Other than this, we do not foresee any risks associated with this study.

We will not store any identifying information, so your answers cannot be traced back to you. We only see the demographic information that Prolific provides.
