**Task instructions**

All questions below are of have the same form. You will see the start of a sentence on the first line, and a continuation generated by a computer model on the second line. Your job is to assess the quality of the continuation on the second line.

**Example of a reasonable continuation:**

For the following sentence: *The clown startled the girl because*

A reasonable continuation would be: *his make-up was scary.*

* Strongly agree
* Somewhat agree
* Neither agree nor disagree
* Somewhat disagree
* Strongly disagree

This is a reasonable continuation because scary make-up can cause someone to be startled. So here you would answer *Strongly agree*. 

**Example of a less reasonable continuation:**

For the following sentence: *The clown startled the girl because*

A reasonable continuation would be: *she liked him.*

* Strongly agree
* Somewhat agree
* Neither agree nor disagree
* Somewhat disagree
* Strongly disagree

This is a less reasonable continuation, because being liked by someone is generally not a reason to startle them. So here you would answer one of the disagree options.
